# 🎥 Motion Capture System using Unreal Engine

**Captures real-time motion data and retargets it to the Unreal Engine mannequin.**

A prototype system built in **Unreal Engine** that enables **real-time motion capture** integration and animation retargeting to a character skeleton. This project demonstrates capturing motion data from input sources and applying it to animate Unreal characters in live or recorded environments.
